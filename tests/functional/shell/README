All scripts are in the form "name.XX.EXT" where :
	* name should be a descriptive short string for the test
	* XX is the number of instances that this test requires
	* EXT is the extension of the script

all script expect environment variables MNT{1 .. XX} and HOME{1 .. XX} that are
respectively the mount point of the instance i and the INFINIT_HOME related to
the spawned instance.

For example, a test could be:

cat > testing_env.3.sh << EOF

# Checking that env var are defined

[ -z "$MNT1" ] && exit 1
[ -z "$HOME1" ] && exit 1
[ -z "$MNT2" ] && exit 1
[ -z "$HOME2" ] && exit 1
[ -z "$MNT3" ] && exit 1
[ -z "$HOME3" ] && exit 1

EOF
