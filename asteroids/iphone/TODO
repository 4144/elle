What has been done :
- API interactions
    * Register
    * Login with remember user option
    * Get networks names
    * errors
- File explorer
- File read
- File add (with custom naming)
    * Folder
    * Choose from photo roll
    * Take picture with camera (.jpg)
    * Download file with copy/paste of the url (percentage growing when DLing)
- iCloud backup disabled
- Custom swipe to reveal menu
    * Email file
    * Delete file
- Options menu is ready (only logout button for now)
- Notification system (used only for "No network connection")
- Header pull to refresh
- Search files
- Edit menu when long pressing a cell (navigate and select files then) :
    * Move
    * Copy (both in currently viewed directory)
- When user changes, local files are deleted (warning and confirm)


What needs to be done :
- Full Connection / Deconnection detection (when trying to get files for example)
- Get files from other infinit nodes
- Implement pin/unpin (= delete from ios local files but not from network)
- Invite people to join networks using iOS contacts address book
- Localization (FR, Chinese, Klingon, ...)
- Make some of the PNG hi-res for retina display (like swipe to reveal buttons for ex)
- Fill network info window

What is worth thinking :
- Footer pull to load more is disabled (the idea was to list files by 100 batch but that may not be a critical need)
- Sort/Filter
- Download percentage (maybe not clear enough ?)
- Photo flow (take mutliple pictures without being asked for file names)
- Add Options ?
