# ---------- overview ---------------------------------------------------------
#

The Infinit file system project aims at providing a secure large-scale
peer-to-peer file system which will be used in the context of the kayou
distributed operating system, amongst others.

More information can be found on the Infinit file system's web site:

   http://i.nfin.it

The project was written in C++ as an external, userland server. The
engineering choice were made so that the file system interface is not
constraint by the POSIX API.

This particular architecture does not limit the file system's
functionalities. Indeed, UNIX commands issue syscalls which are
retransmitted to the Infinit server through the FUSE interface.
Additionally, Infinit-specific applications communicate directly
with the server, following the Infinit file system interface.

#
# ---------- organisation -----------------------------------------------------
#

The tests/ and benchmarks/ directories obviously contain tests and
benchmarks used for validation purposes.

The sources/ directory contains the source code of the components
composing the Infinit file system.

The scripts/ directory contains additional files such as the
mount.infinit binary etc.

Finally, the documentation/ directory contain some documentation. Note
that source code documentation is also generated through the Doxygen
marking system.
