       * one renaming the argument 'attribute1' in something else would
       * note see any error (assuming no underscore prefix is used for
       * attributes) because naming 'attribute1' without 'this->' would
       * still be valid. By prefixing attributes, an error would be
       * generated.
       *
       * Secondly, 'this->' must be used *at all times* in order to
       * make it clear that the attribute is accessed while limiting
       * further naming problems.
