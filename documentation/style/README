Such a README file should be provided for every module, describing
the module, its purpose, its dependencies etc.

Noteworthy is that every module should provide a sources/ directory
and a tests/ directory. In other words, the following hierarchy should
be found in every library name ${LIBRARY}:

  ${LIBRARY}/
    drakefile
    README
    LICENCE
    sources/
      ${LIBRARY}/
        fwd.hh
        all.hh
        File1.hh
        File1.cc
        File2.hh
        File2.cc
        [...]
    tests/
      ${LIBRARY}/
        File1.cc
        File2.cc
        [...]
