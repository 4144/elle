If you wish to run the test locally.

$ DIR_BUILD=<path to your dirbuild> DIR_SOURCE=<path to your sourcedir> ./test

By default, DIR_BUILD is set to ../build and DIR_SOURCE to ../source.

In order to have a preview of the available options, just do:
$ DIR_BUILD=<path to your dirbuild> DIR_SOURCE=<path to your sourcedir> ./test -h

Example:


# Run all the functionals test in ${DIR_SOURCE}/tests/functionals/scripts
$ DIR_BUILD=../build/ DIR_SOURCE=../ ./test

# Run only on test:
# Note that you have to specify the name of the test; for instance if the filename is test.2.py then:
$ DIR_BUILD=../build/ DIR_SOURCE=../ ./test -s test
