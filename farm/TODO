The farm relies on the buildbot software for building and testing
Infinit in different environments: operating system, architecture
etc.

One can create a master node as follows:

  $> buildbot create-master master/

Then, the master configuration file must be copied in
the directory:

  $> cp ${INFINIT_DEV_DIR}/farm/master/master.cfg master/

Create a slave on a machine according to the slaves
recorded in the master configuration file:

  $> buildslave create-slave slave/ [master-host]:[master-port] [slave-name] [master-password]

Finally, launch both the master and the slaves:

  $> buildbot start master/
  $> buildslave start slave/
